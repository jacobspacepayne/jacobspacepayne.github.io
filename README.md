# Hi, I'm Jacob. 👋

I am a fourth year PhD student at the University of Iowa studying ⚛️ pulsars and optics for x-ray 🔭 telescopes.

My work has two main branches: pulsar emission analysis using measurements taken by the [NICER](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/nicer/) telescope on the International Space Station, and glass forming to produce smooth substrates for multilayer coatings that are reflective to X-ray photons. I am interested in using pulsars as references for autonomous interplanetary navigation.

When I'm not in the lab, I ride bikes, sit mindlessly, care for my cat Feadog, and play bagpipes with the Turlach Ur Pipe Band in Grinell, Iowa.
