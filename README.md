Hello World!

I am a Graduate Research Assistant at the State University of Iowa.
I study Physics & Astronomy. In particular, I am interested in modeling X-ray emission from Pulsars to create better telescopes and use Pulsars as a reference for autonomous interplanetary navigation.

You can read more about this project here:
[X-ray Pulsar Navigation Instrument Performance and Scale Analysis](https://repository.gatech.edu/entities/publication/63435d46-d94e-4a9a-b8d0-7056988c3c73)

I use observations taken with the [NICER](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/nicer/) telescope on the International Space Station.
